/*There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note:
All costs are positive integers.

Example:

Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue. 
             Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.*/

class Solution {
public:
    int minCost(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {
        int m = costs.size();
        if(m == 0) return 0;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m,vector<int>(3,0));
        dp[0][0] = costs[0][0];
        dp[0][1] = costs[0][1];
        dp[0][2] = costs[0][2];
        for(int i = 1;i != costs.size();++i){
            dp[i][0] = min(dp[i-1][1],dp[i-1][2]) + costs[i][0];
            dp[i][1] = min(dp[i-1][0],dp[i-1][2]) + costs[i][1];
            dp[i][2] = min(dp[i-1][0],dp[i-1][1]) + costs[i][2];
        }
        return min(min(dp[m-1][0],dp[m-1][1]),dp[m-1][2]);
    }
};
